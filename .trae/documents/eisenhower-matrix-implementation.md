## 3. Core Process

### Main User Flow

1. **Task Creation**: User creates task → AI analyzes urgency/importance → Task auto-assigned to appropriate quadrant
2. **Matrix Navigation**: User views dashboard → Sees tasks organized in 2x2 grid → Can switch to full matrix view
3. **Task Management**: User interacts with quadrant-specific actions → Moves tasks between quadrants → Completes tasks based on priority
4. **Analytics Review**: User checks productivity metrics → Reviews time allocation → Receives AI recommendations

### 4.3 Responsiveness

Desktop-first design with mobile-adaptive matrix that stacks quadrants vertically on smaller screens. Touch-optimized drag-and-drop with haptic feedback for mobile devices.

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- Add new columns to existing todos table
ALTER TABLE todos ADD COLUMN urgency INTEGER DEFAULT 1 CHECK (urgency IN (1, 2, 3));
ALTER TABLE todos ADD COLUMN importance INTEGER DEFAULT 1 CHECK (importance IN (1, 2, 3));
ALTER TABLE todos ADD COLUMN matrix_quadrant INTEGER DEFAULT 1 CHECK (matrix_quadrant IN (1, 2, 3, 4));
ALTER TABLE todos ADD COLUMN ai_confidence DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.5;

-- Create index for matrix queries
CREATE INDEX idx_todos_matrix_quadrant ON todos(matrix_quadrant, userId);
CREATE INDEX idx_todos_urgency_importance ON todos(urgency, importance, userId);
```

### 5.2 Quadrant Calculation Logic

```typescript
function calculateQuadrant(urgency: number, importance: number): number {
  if (urgency >= 2 && importance >= 2) return 1; // Urgent & Important
  if (urgency < 2 && importance >= 2) return 2;  // Not Urgent & Important
  if (urgency >= 2 && importance < 2) return 3;  // Urgent & Not Important
  return 4; // Not Urgent & Not Important
}
```

### 5.3 AI Enhancement Specification

**Enhanced AI Categorization Prompt**:
```
Analyze this task for Eisenhower Matrix categorization:

Title: {title}
Description: {description}
Due Date: {dueDate}

Determine:
1. Urgency level (1-3): Based on time sensitivity, deadlines, and immediate consequences
2. Importance level (1-3): Based on long-term impact, goal alignment, and strategic value
3. Matrix quadrant (1-4): Calculated from urgency/importance intersection
4. Confidence score (0-1): AI's confidence in the categorization
5. Reasoning: Brief explanation of the categorization logic
6. Recommended action: Specific guidance based on quadrant (Do, Schedule, Delegate, Delete)
```
